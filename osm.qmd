# Introduction

This practical was developed for the [OpenGeoHub summer school 2023](https://pretalx.earthmonitor.org/opengeohub-summer-school-2023/schedule/).

As outlined in the session abstract, will cover

-  How and where to download OSM data
-  How to process small amounts of OSM data using the osmdata R package
-  How to process large OSM ‘extracts’ data with the osmextract R package
-  Other command line tools for working with OSM data, including the mature and widely used osmium tool, the pyrosm Python package and the osm2streets web application and Rust codebase

Finally, the session will outline ideas for using OSM data to support the fast and fair decarbonisation of the global economy.

# Prerequisites

To participate in the session, all you need is R and following packages:

```r
pkgs = c(
    "tidyverse",
    "osmdata",
    "osmextract"
)
remotes::install_cran(pkgs)
```

You may want to install the following packages for @sec-command-line:

- [osmium](https://osmcode.org/osmium-tool/)
- [pyrosm](https://pyrosm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [osm2streets](https://a-b-street.github.io/osm2streets/#1/0/0) (although this is currently mostly a web UI and does not have a command line interface)

# How and where to download OSM data {#sec-download}

As outlined in the [`providers_comparison`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/articles/providers_comparisons.html) vignettte in the [`osmextract`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/) package, there are several providers of OSM data. The main ones that provide regular extracts without need for logins are:

- [geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
- [openstreetmap_fr](http://download.openstreetmap.fr/)
- [bbbike](https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/)


```{r}
library(osmextract)
library(sf)
```

Extracts from each provider are shown in the figures below, generated by code that can be 'unfolded' by clicking on the arrows:


## Geofabrik

`geofabrik` is a company that provides map-based services and free downloads of OSM extracts that are updated daily. 
These extracts are based on a division of the world into different regions, at 4 different levels.
Zones in level 1 cover a whole continent (plus Russian Federation): 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
par(mar = rep(0, 4))
plot(geofabrik_zones[geofabrik_zones$level == 1, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

Level 2 contains polygons representing several countries all around the world: 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot(geofabrik_zones[geofabrik_zones$level == 2, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

Geofabrik also defines several special zones, such as Alps, Britain and Ireland, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, US Midwest, US Northeast, US Pacific, US South and US West (level 3).
Moreover, it contains extracts relative to some administrative subregions, mainly in Europe, Russia, Canada and South America: 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot(geofabrik_zones[geofabrik_zones$level == 3, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

Check `?geofabrik_zones` and the [provider's webpage](http://download.geofabrik.de/) for more details. 

## Openstreetmap.fr

`openstreetmap_fr` extracts are taken from http://download.openstreetmap.fr/, a web-service that provides OSM data updated every few minutes. 
The extracts are based on several regions, such as the continents (level 1): 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# Russian federation is considered as a level 1 zone
plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[openstreetmap_fr_zones$level == 1, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

or some countries around the world (less than `geofabrik`'s level 2 zones): 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[openstreetmap_fr_zones$level == 2, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

It can be noticed that there are several holes (such as Peru, which is the reason why, in the first example, Lima was matched with South America data), implying that `openstreetmap_fr` cannot always be used for geographical matching of a `place`. 
Nevertheless, it provides extremely detailed extracts for some regions of the world, like China, 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent == "china", "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

India, 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent == "india", "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

France, 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ids_2 = openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent %in% "france"
ids_3 = openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent %in% openstreetmap_fr_zones$id[ids_2]

plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[ids_2 | ids_3, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

and Brazil

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ids_2 = openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent %in% "brazil"
ids_3 = openstreetmap_fr_zones$parent %in% openstreetmap_fr_zones$id[ids_2]

plot(openstreetmap_fr_zones[ids_2 | ids_3, "name"], key.pos = NULL, main = NULL)
```

## BBBike

`bbbike` provider is based on https://download.bbbike.org/osm/bbbike/. 
It is quite different from any other provider supported in `osmextract` since it contains OSM data for more than 200 cities worldwide. 

![](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/reference/figures/96640949-3f7f7480-1324-11eb-9dca-a971c8103a4e.png)

`bbbike` provider is the safest choice if you are looking for OSM data relative to a particular city in the world.

# How to process small amounts of OSM data using the osmdata R package {#sec-osmdata}

The [osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmdata) package is a mature and widely used tool for working with OSM data in R. It is designed to work with small amounts of data, such as the area around a city or a country. It is not designed to work with large amounts of data, such as the whole of Europe or the world. For that, we need a different approach, which is covered in the next section.


#  How to process large OSM ‘extracts’ data with the osmextract R package {#sec-osmextract}

The quickest way to get large OSM datasets in R (and possibly in any data analysis framework) is to use the [`osmextract`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmextract/) package.

The package makes your life easy by automating many parts of the OSM extract identification, download, and processing pipeline, so you can focus on the analysis and high-impact reasearch!

## Finding an extract to download

Let's see how it works for the city of Poznan:


```{r}
library(osmextract)
library(sf)
```

We geocode the coordinates of Poznan, Poland

```{r, eval = FALSE}
poznan = tmaptools::geocode_OSM("Poznan, Poland")$coords
# poznan = c(x = 16.933, y = 52.408)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
dput(poznan)
c(x = 16.9335199, y = 52.4082663)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
poznan = c(x = 16.933, y = 52.408)
```

and look for a match in the OSM extracts using `oe_match()`: 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
oe_match(poznan, provider = "geofabrik")
oe_match(poznan, provider = "bbbike")
oe_match(poznan, provider = "openstreetmap_fr")
```

As shown above, `bbbike` is the only provide that provides a match for Poznan (the others match with all of Poland).
